# Overview
Rock Paper Scissors contains images from a variety of different hands,  from different races, ages and genders, posed into Rock / Paper or Scissors and labelled as such. You can download the training set and the test set . These images have all been generated using CGI techniques as an experiment in determining if a CGI-based dataset can be used for classification against real images. I also generated a few images that you can use for predictions. 

Note that all of this data is posed against a white background.

Each image is 300Ã—300 pixels in 24-bit color
